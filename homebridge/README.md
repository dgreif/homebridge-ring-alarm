This [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin provides a platform for
[Ring Doorbells](https://shop.ring.com/pages/doorbell-cameras),
[Ring Cameras](https://shop.ring.com/pages/security-cameras),
the [Ring Alarm System](https://shop.ring.com/pages/security-system),
[Ring Smart Lighting](https://shop.ring.com/pages/smart-lighting),
and third party devices that connect to the Ring Alarm System.

## Installation

Assuming a global installation of `homebridge`:

`npm i -g --unsafe-perm homebridge-ring`

## Homebridge Configuration

Add the `Ring` platform in your homebridge `config.json` file.

### Easiest Configuration

For the best experience setting up this plugin, please use [homebridge-config-ui-x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-config-ui-x) or [HOOBS](https://hoobs.org/).  Both have a UI that will walk you through linking your account without any cli tools or storing your email/password.

### Basic Configuration

First, generate a `refreshToken` using the instructions in the [Refresh Tokens Wiki](https://github.com/dgreif/ring/wiki/Refresh-Tokens)

 ```json
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "Ring",
      "refreshToken": "token generated with ring-auth-cli.  See https://github.com/dgreif/ring/wiki/Refresh-Tokens"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Optional Parameters
Only include an optional parameter if you actually need it.  Default behavior without any of the optional parameters should be sufficient for most users.

 ```json
{
  "alarmOnEntryDelay": true,
  "beamDurationSeconds": 60,
  "hideDeviceIds": ["477e4800-fcde-4493-969b-d1a06f683102", "5aaed7a7-06df-4f18-b3af-291c89854d60"],
  "hideLightGroups": true,
  "hideDoorbellSwitch": true,
  "hideCameraMotionSensor": true,
  "sendCameraMotionNotificationsToTv": true,
  "sendDoorbellMotionNotificationsToTv": true,
  "hideCameraSirenSwitch": true,
  "hideInHomeDoorbellSwitch": true,
  "hideAlarmSirenSwitch": true,
  "hideUnsupportedServices": true,
  "avoidSnapshotBatteryDrain": true,
  "cameraStatusPollingSeconds": 20,
  "cameraDingsPollingSeconds": 2,
  "locationModePollingSeconds": 20,
  "locationIds": ["488e4800-fcde-4493-969b-d1a06f683102", "4bbed7a7-06df-4f18-b3af-291c89854d60"],
  "categoryIdOverrides": { "f259b31c-826c-4b42-92f5-699927cbe032": 2 }
}
```

Option | Default | Explanation
--- | --- | ---
`alarmOnEntryDelay` | `false` | if `true`, HomeKit will register a delayed entry event as a triggered alarm.  There are some households where this is a nice feature as a heads up if you have other people who enter your house and you want an alert so that you can disable the alarm for them before it actually goes off. This works well if you automatically arm/disarm on leave/arrive (see setup instructions below)
`beamDurationSeconds` | `60` for light groups, previous from Ring app for individual lights | Ring smart lighting has a default behavior of only staying on for 60 seconds when you turn on a light via the Ring app.  To force a duration when the light is turned on from HomeKit, set this option to a specific number of seconds. If this option is not set, the lights will use the duration from the previous time the light was turned on in the Ring app. For light groups, this will default to 60 seconds. The maximum value is `32767`, which is ~9.1 hours.
`hideDeviceIds` | `[]` | Allows you to hide specific devices by an array of ids.  The id for each device is logged when homebridge starts.
`hideLightGroups` | `false` | Ring smart lighting allows you to create lighting groups within the Ring app. These groups are convenient for detecting motion in an area of your yard and turning on/off all lights in the group.  However, you may wish to group the lights differently in HomeKit and ignore the groups you have configured in Ring.  If this option is `true`, your Ring groups (and their associated motion sensor) will be ignored and will not show up in HomeKit.
`hideDoorbellSwitch` | `false` | If you have a Ring video doorbell, you will see a Programmable Switch associated with it.  This switch can be used to perform actions on when the doorbell is pressed using "Single Press" actions.  If you do not care to perform actions when the doorbell is pressed, you can hide the Programmable Switch by setting this option to `true`. You will still be able to receive _notifications_ from the doorbell even if the Programmable Switch is hidden (notifications can be configured in the settings for the doorbell camera in the Home app)
`hideCameraMotionSensor` | `false` | If `true`, hides the motion sensor for Ring cameras in HomeKit.
`sendCameraMotionNotificationsToTv` | `false` | If `true`, creates a 'Doorbell' accessory triggered by non-doorbell camera motion alerts for tvOS 14 notification support.
`sendDoorbellMotionNotificationsToTv` | `false` | If `true`, motion events on doorbell cameras will trigger a doorbell press event for tvOS 14 notification support.
`hideCameraSirenSwitch` | `false` | If `true`, hides the siren switch for Ring cameras in HomeKit.
`hideInHomeDoorbellSwitch` | `false` | If `true`, hides the switch for in-home doorbells in HomeKit.
`hideAlarmSirenSwitch` | `false` | If you have a Ring Alarm, you will see both the alarm and a "Siren" switch in HomeKit.  The siren switch can sometimes get triggered by Siri commands by accident, which is loud and annoying.  Set this option to `true` to hide the siren switch.
`hideUnsupportedServices` | `false` | If `true`, hides the alarm Base Station and Keypad devices in HomeKit.  These are only supported by third-party HomeKit apps, not the native Home app.
`showPanicButtons` | `false` | Creates a new `Panic Buttons` device in HomeKit with `Burglar Alarm` and `Fire Alarm` switches.  **Use these at your own risk.  I do not guarantee functionality in case of emergency, nor do I take responsibility for any false alarms**.  These function just like the SOS sliders in the Ring app.
`nightModeBypassFor` | no Night Mode | Allows you to use Night mode to "Bypass and Arm" a Ring Alarm.  Can be set to `all` for Away or `some` for Home.  If set and Night mode is activated from HomeKit, any open contact sensors will automatically be bypassed.
`avoidSnapshotBatteryDrain` | false | Causes snapshots for battery cameras to be fetched at a minimum 10 minute interval to avoid draining the battery.
`cameraStatusPollingSeconds` | `20` | How frequently to poll for updates to your cameras and chimes (in seconds).  Information like light/siren/volume/snooze status do not update in real time and need to be requested periodically.
`cameraDingsPollingSeconds` | `2` | How frequently to poll for new events from your cameras.  These include motion and doorbell presses.
`locationModePollingSeconds` | `20` | How frequently to poll for location mode updates (in seconds).  This is only useful if you are using location modes to control camera settings and want to keep an up-to-date reference of the current mode for each location.  Polling is automatically disabled for locations equipped with a Ring Alarm.  Will hide Location Mode switch if set to `0`
`locationIds` | All Locations | Use this option if you only want a subset of your locations to appear in HomeKit. If this option is not included, all of your locations will be added to HomeKit (which is what most users will want to do).
`onlyDeviceTypes` | All Device Types | A subset of device types to be shown.  If set, all other device types will be hidden in HomeKit.
`categoryIdOverrides` | `{}` | A map of device identifiers to [device categories](https://github.com/dgreif/ring/blob/154f8fa817b7287fae28ced3c976c0de2fc31eae/api/ring-types.ts#L44-L62), used to override the device category reported by the Ring API.
`ffmpegPath` | Uses `ffmpeg-for-homebridge` | A custom path to the `ffmpeg` executable.  By default, the static binaries built in [ffmpeg-for-homebridge](https://github.com/oznu/ffmpeg-for-homebridge) will be used.  If you prefer to use your own version of ffmpeg, you can pass a complete path, or simply `"ffmpeg"` to use ffmpeg from your `PATH`.
`debug` | false | Turns on additional logging.  In particular, ffmpeg logging.

### Cameras

  * Camera Feed
    * Shows a snapshot from the camera while viewing the room in Home.  There are limitations on when battery cameras can take snapshots.  See [the Snapshot Limitations Wiki](https://github.com/dgreif/ring/wiki/Snapshot-Limitations) for details.
    * Shows a live feed from the camera if you click on it.  The feed supports video and 2-way audio, but requires that you have `ffmpeg` with `libfdk_aac` installed.  A pre-built `ffmpeg` will be automatically installed on most platforms using `ffmpeg-for-homebridge`.  See the [FFmpeg wiki](https://github.com/dgreif/ring/wiki/FFmpeg) for details.
  * Motion Sensor
    * Can be hidden with `hideCameraMotionSensor`
    * Can trigger doorbell events with `sendCameraMotionNotificationsToTv` and `sendDoorbellMotionNotificationsToTv` for tvOS 14 notifications
  * Light (if camera is equipped)
  * Siren Switch (if camera is equipped)
    * Can be hidden with `hideCameraSirenSwitch`
  * In-Home Doorbell Switch (if doorbell is equipped)
    * This will turn your physical in-home doorbell (mechanical/digital) on and off.  Useful for automating situations where you don't want your in-home doorbell to ring during certain situations, such as when a child's night light is on, or during certain hours of the night.
    * Can be hidden with `hideInHomeDoorbellSwitch`
  * Programmable switch for doorbells (triggers `Single Press` actions)
    * Note: doorbell event notifications should be configured via settings on the camera feed
    * Can be hidden with `hideDoorbellSwitch`

If you turn on notifications for the motion sensors, or for any doorbell camera, you will get rich notifications from
HomeKit with a snapshot from the camera

If you are having issues with your cameras in the Home app, please see the [Camera Troubleshooting Wiki](https://github.com/dgreif/ring/wiki/Camera-Troubleshooting)

`Set Ring Alarm to Stay` | Home mode activated
`Arm my security system for stay` | Home mode activated
`Disarm Ring Alarm` | Disarmed
`Disarm my security system` | Disarmed
`Turn on Ring Alarm` | Turns on Ring Alarm Siren (unless hideAlarmSirenSwitch is set)
`Turn off Ring Alarm` | Turns off Ring Alarm Siren (unless hideAlarmSirenSwitch is set)

### Changes Modes on Arrive/Leave Home

The Home app allows you to create an automation that runs when you arrive/leave home.  If you include an accessory or
scene that "allows access" to your home (e.g. Security System or Lock), the Home app will require you to manually verify
that you actually want to run the automation every time it gets triggered.  For anyone who wants to arm/disarm their
Ring Alarm automatically, this manual verification can be quite annoying.  To work around this issue, you can add two
"dummy" switches to you homebridge setup using [homebridge-dummy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-dummy).  You
can then use these dummy switches to trigger your other automation (e.g. Arm/Disarm Ring Alarm).

#### Example Dummy Config
```json
{
    "accessories": [
        {
          "accessory": "DummySwitch",
          "name": "Arrived Home"
        },
        {
          "accessory": "DummySwitch",
          "name": "Left Home"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Example Home Automations

Trigger | Action
--- | ---
People Arrive | Turn on "Arrived Home"
People Leave | Turn on "Left Home"
"Arrived Home" turns on | Set Ring Alarm mode to Off
"Left Home" turns on | Set Ring Alarm mode to Away
